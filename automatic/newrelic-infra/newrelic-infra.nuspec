    <summary>New Relic Infrastructure is an agent which provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[New Relic Infrastructure is an agent which provides flexible, dynamic
server monitoring. Infrastructure empowers modern operations teams to make 
intelligent decisions about complex systems, from a physical datacenter to 
thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or Microsoft Azure 
instances.

Real-time metrics and powerful analytics reduce your mean-time-to-resolution 
(MTTR) by connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration. 
Hosts are automatically added and removed from the interface as they are created 
and destroyed, and a powerful Events page lets you see every change.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is 
out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and
let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.
